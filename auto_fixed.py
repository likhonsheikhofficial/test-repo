Here's a corrected version of the code:
```python
def corrected_function():
    try:
        result = 1 / 0
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")
        result = None
    return result
```
Explanation:

The corrected function uses a try-except block to handle the potential ZeroDivisionError that occurs when dividing by zero. If a ZeroDivisionError is caught, the function prints an error message and returns None. This follows best practices by handling exceptions gracefully and avoiding crashing the program.
